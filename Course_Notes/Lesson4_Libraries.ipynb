(either created by you or other parties) that you can use in your program \n","- A module is a library that has one or more functions in it \n","  - Libraries and Modules are great for re-using your own code as well as using other peoples functions so that you can work soley on solving your problem at hand\n","\n","- import: used to import a module into your program\n","- from: used to import functions from a module\n","\n","Command line arguements allow you to pass in values (i.e. arguements) into the program during its initiation \n","- sys.argv is a variable that stores the list of words that the user inputted in the command line (sys.argv[0] is the file name and sys.argv[1] stores the first arguement)\n","\n","\n","Packages are 3rd party libraries that can be import and used in your program\n","- use https://pypi.org/ to find all python packages\n","- use the pip command to install packages (pip is a package manager)\n","  - When you want to use a package in your program you first have to install it via pip install command and then import it at the top of your file\n","\n","\n","API is an application programing interface (most apis are internet based)\n","- use the requests package to make web-based calls to online APIs\n","- can use requests.get(url) to get api values\n","\n","JSON (java scipt object notation) is a language angnustic format (meaning any
